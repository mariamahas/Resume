      <p><strong>Brian coyle </strong> - Commuinty Center</p>
      <p>
        I worked with the underprivileged youth at this community center and
        helped them navigate the transition from middle school to high school
        during the summer. I really enjoyed working with those kids because they
        taught me a lot about myself. They taught me how to appreciate the
        little things in life, they gave me a sense of purpose and inspired me
        to continue working with underprivileged kids.
